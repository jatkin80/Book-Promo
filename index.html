      <p>
      JavaScript is the programming language of the web. The overwhelming majority of websites use JavaScript, and all
      modern web browsers—on desktops,
      tablets, and phones—include JavaScript interpreters, making JavaScript the most-deployed programming language in
      history. Over the last decade,
      Node.js has enabled JavaScript programming outside of web browsers, and the dramatic success of Node means that
      JavaScript is now also the
      most-used programming language among software developers. Whether you’re starting from scratch or are already
      using JavaScript professionally,
      this book will help you master the language.
